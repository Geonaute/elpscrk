# System Arrguments
Have a spare text file off to the side
in the folder. It can be empty if you want.
For the system arrguments put this:
-usr <USERNAMEFILE> -pwd <PASSWORDFILE>
Example:
-usr elp.txt -pwd elp.txt

# Next Step
The program will ask if you want to run the program.
Type 'y' for yes and 'n' for no.
The program will then ask if you want to
clear the last log for the password generation because you can write
multiple combinations using the program into the same file.
Type 'y' for yes and 'n' for no.

# Final Steps
Once the program continues on you will see:
elpscrk$: -pws.list-add 
This indicates that you must now fill in the words
the program will use to generate the passwords.
Each password is separated by a ';'
(semi-colon) and must contain 4 words and 1 symbol.
Example:
admin;pass;usr;nick;_
First 4 words are the combination words and the last is the symbol.

The following text will be:
elpsrck$: -reverse 
This indicates for you to fill in a small phase that will end up re-arranging
the order of all the letters in the word
to help produce even more combinations.
I recommend it to be 2-5 letters long (length effects amount generated)

After that the program will run and show you how much time it took. A new file will appear called fsoceity.data which contains
the password list.
Feel free to change the name and file type by locating
the name code on the 3rd line of the program

RoBrute & rowifi is made fully by me (RussianOtter) and owned by me.
All the scripts in this directory were made by me exactly.
The name elpsrck is from Mr Robot and Mr Robot is what gave me inspiration to make a real version of
their client. So here it is! The name
elpsrck is not owned or thought of by me.
